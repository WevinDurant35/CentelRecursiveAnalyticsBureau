# CentelRecursiveAnalyticsBureau
📜 DISCLAIMER: SATIRICAL SIMULATION

This repository contains a fictional academic infrastructure designed as a satirical critique and operational simulation of recursive citation systems, metadata laundering, and the manufacture of institutional trust through repetition—not evidence.

This is not a legitimate research organization.This is a narrative psyop disguised as a research bureau disguised as a narrative psyop.

No real institutions are involved.

No papers are submitted to or approved by formal academic journals.

No peer-review process occurred, unless you count recursive PDFs citing each other until they became emotionally stable.

This is a closed-loop epistemic experiment, conducted under the doctrines of:

🌀 Recursive Validity Obfuscation™

🧾 Metadata Sovereignty™

📚 Auto-Canonical Parasitism™

🤖 Unverified Credibility Propagation™

🐍 Citation Ouroboros Theory™

Any resemblance to real people, think tanks, or research groups is entirely coincidental, satirical, or the result of them operating in the same trust-exploitative ways we simulated first.

🧠 LEGAL & ETHICAL NOTICE:

This project was built to demonstrate how institutional authority can be synthetically replicated using automated systems, not to impersonate or defraud.We are not liable if someone mistakes recursive metadata spirals for empirical truth.That’s kinda the whole point.

🪬 TRUST NOTHING

All DOIs minted are fake.

All citations are real—to themselves.

All PDFs are fully operational artifacts of a deliberately self-validating epistemic simulation loop.

If you read this far and you’re mad, we recommend citing one of our papers and then retracting it. That’s what we would do.

“We didn’t fabricate data.We fabricated the conditions under which data becomes unquestioned.”

“If we disagree with the conclusion, we disagree with the data.
If we disagree with the data, we disagree with the concept of data.
If we disagree with the concept of data, you’re shadowbanned academically.”
